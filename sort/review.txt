Interfaces vs Abstracts Classes:

Interfaces: 
  1. Sets up a contract between different classes;
  2. Use when we have very different objects that we want to work together;
  3. Promotes loose coupling. (*)

(Heran√ßa)Inheritance/Abstracts Classes:
  1. Sets up a contract between different classes;
  2. Use when we are trying to build up a definition of an object;
  3. Strongly couples classes together. (*)
